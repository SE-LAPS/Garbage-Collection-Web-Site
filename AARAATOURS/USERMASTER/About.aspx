						<h4>Clean Colombo, Together: Join CMC's Optimized Garbage Collection Initiative</h4>

						<p>Welcome to the Colombo Municipal Council's (CMC) optimized garbage collection website! Our goal is to create a cleaner and healthier environment for the residents of Colombo by providing a platform for volunteers to report incidents of thrown away garbage in their district. By using this website, you can help ensure that garbage is collected in a timely and efficient manner, reducing its negative impact on the environment and public health. With the help of dedicated volunteers, CMC's Green Task Force, and a team of dedicated staff, we are confident that this website will help us achieve our goals of a cleaner, greener Colombo.</p>
